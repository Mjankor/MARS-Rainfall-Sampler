# MARS-Rainfall-Sampler
A daily/monthly autonomous rainfall sampler for isotope research

Instructions for construction are being put together here:

If you're interested in helping, there are several things that should be improved. In particular:
1) A way to resolve the memory effect associated with the tipping bucket. Either a way to tip the bucket manually after a certain amount of time, or a way to remove the bucket entirely. 
2) A more secure method of joining the vent and inlet hoses (when using the inlet tube method). 
3) A better motor option for the main gear. The little stepper has done well so far, but something with a bit more power would be useful to make sure the turntable and platter never miss steps. Caveat - can't use much more power.
